Statamic CP Theme Override
================================

## Installing
1. Download the zip file (or clone via git) and unzip it or clone the repo into `/_add-ons/`.
2. Ensure the folder name is `override` (Github timestamps the download folder). Feel free to rename if you wish.
3. Enjoy.

## Usage

This add-on will simply load the included css file after all other stylesheets, allowing you to restyle the theme as you see fit.
